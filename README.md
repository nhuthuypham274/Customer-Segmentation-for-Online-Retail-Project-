********Customer Segmentation by Cohort Analysis and RFM Modelling********

#**Problem Statement**
In the retail Industry, it is a critical requirement for businesses to understand the value derived from their customers. RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value.

Customer segmentation is the practice of segregating the customer base into groups of individuals based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits.

Our objective here is to perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).

#**Dataset Description**
This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions that occurred between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique and all-occasion gifts.
